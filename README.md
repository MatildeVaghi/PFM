**Precision functional mapping of indidivudals with depression**
------ 

This repository contains code related to "Expansion of a frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression‚Äù (in revision),
including routines for mapping functional brain networks in individual subjects.

Usage
------ 

The "pfm_example_use.m" script implements the entire precision funcional mapping (PFM) procedure, including concatenation of the individual scans ("concatenate_scans.m"), generating a distance matrix ("make_distance_matrix.m"), applying the infomap community detection algorithm ("pfm_wrapper.m"), and algorithmically assigning network identities to the resulting infomap communities ("pfm_identify_networks.m"). This code assumes that the resting-state fMRI dataset is already fully preprocessed, denoised, and surface-registered (see https://github.com/cjl2007/Liston-Laboratory-MultiEchofMRI-Pipeline).
