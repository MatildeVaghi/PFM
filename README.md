This codebase contains code for delineating functional brain networks entirely within individual subjects --- a procedure called precision functional mapping (PFM; see Gordon et al. 2017 Neuron). 

The "pfm_tutorial.m" script (located in the ~/PFM-Depression/PFM-Tutorial) calls multiple Matlab scripts for performing PFM from ~/PFM-Depression/PFM-Tutorial/Utilities. This code can be run using an example PFM-style dataset we have uploaded to OpenNeuro.org (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005118/versions/1.0.0) and following step-by-step instructions outlined in the .pdf document "pfm_tutorial_instructions".
