**Precision functional mapping of indidivudals with depression**
------ 

This repository contains code related to "Expansion of a frontostriatal salience network in individuals with depression‚Äù (in revision),
including routines for mapping functional brain networks in individual subjects. 

Usage
------ 

The "pfm_example_use.m" script assumes that the contains code for implimeting the entire precision funcional mapping (PFM) procedure. 
This code assumes that the resting-state fMRI dataset is fully preprocessed, denoised, and surface-registered (see https://github.com/cjl2007/Liston-Laboratory-MultiEchofMRI-Pipeline).
